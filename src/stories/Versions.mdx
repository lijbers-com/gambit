# 🔄 Version Management

## Multi-Version Application Strategy

The Gambit platform uses a sophisticated versioning strategy that enables parallel development of different user experience paradigms, feature sets, and experimental workflows while maintaining code consistency and development efficiency.

## 🎯 Versioning Philosophy

### Core Objectives

1. **Enable Rapid Experimentation** - Test different UX approaches without disrupting existing users
2. **Parallel Development** - Multiple teams can work on different version paradigms simultaneously  
3. **Risk Mitigation** - New features can be tested in isolation before general release
4. **User Choice** - Allow users to select the experience that best fits their workflow preferences

### Version Strategy Benefits

- **🚀 Innovation Speed** - Rapid prototyping and testing of new concepts
- **🛡️ Stability** - Existing users unaffected by experimental features
- **🎯 Targeted Features** - Specific versions for specific user segments
- **📊 A/B Testing** - Data-driven decisions on feature adoption
